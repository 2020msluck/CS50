When the flag is pressed
  The boomerang is hidden
  After five seconds
    It appears, in the same coordinates as Gary
  The boomerang moves wherever Gary moves, until the space key is pressed
  If the space key is pressed, and Gary is holding the boomerang, and he is not in the blue zone of the game
    The boomerang moves forward
    While Gary is not holding the boomerang, the costume changes by one, making the boomerang spin
    If the boomerang touches a cockroach
      It reverses direction until it gets to Gary.
    When the boomerang reaches Gary
      It stops, and moves with Gary again
