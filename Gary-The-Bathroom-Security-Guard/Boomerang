When the flag is pressed
The boomerang is hidden
After five seconds, it appears, in the same coordinates as Gary
The boomerang moves wherever Gary moves, until the space key is pressed
If the space key is pressed, and Gary is holding the boomerang, and he is not in the blue zone of the game
The boomerang moves forward
While Gary is not holding the boomerang, the costume changes by one, making the boomerang spin
If the boomerang touches a cockroach, it reverses direction until it gets to Gary.
When the boomerang reaches Gary, it stops, and moves with Gary again
