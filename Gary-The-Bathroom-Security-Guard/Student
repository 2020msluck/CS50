When the flag is pressed

  The students are hidden
When the "1" key is pressed
  The students wait an amount of time and then appear at the rightmost point on the screen
  They begin to move left
  They repeat until they are at the desk, or touching a student in front of them
  If Gary is in the blue zone, and the student is first in line
    They wait two seconds and disappear
    10 seconds later, they reappear and go to line 4
  If one student is touching the other two students 
    The game stops.
