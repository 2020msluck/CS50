**When** the flag is pressed
  <br>The boomerang is hidden
  <br>After five seconds
    <br>It appears, in the same coordinates as Gary
    <br>The boomerang moves wherever Gary moves, until the space key is pressed
  <br>**If** the space key is pressed, and Gary is holding the boomerang, and he is not in the blue zone of the game
    <br>The boomerang moves forward
    <br>**While** Gary is not holding the boomerang, the costume changes by one, making the boomerang spin
    <br>**If** the boomerang touches a cockroach
      <br>It reverses direction until it gets to Gary.
    <br>**When** the boomerang reaches Gary
      <br>It stops, and moves with Gary again
